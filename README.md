# Deco Community Repository
Welcome to the Deco Community repository, a hub for the Deco ecosystem to collaborate and build open source projects together. This repository will serve as a central location for information about community meetings, contributing guidelines, and more.

# Community Meetings
The Deco community hosts regular meetings to discuss ongoing projects, plan new initiatives, and provide updates on the progress of the ecosystem. Meeting information, including links and agendas, will be posted in the meetings directory of this repository.

# Contributing Guidelines
We welcome contributions from the community and want to make the process as easy and straightforward as possible.
